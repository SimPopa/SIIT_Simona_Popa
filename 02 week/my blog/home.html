                    <p>Cows are lovely and majestic animals. They have been domesticated somewhere around 10,000 years ago, and some religions have worshiped and adored them since the beginning of time. </p>

                    <p>As a general rule, cows have been used as a resource throughout history. They provide milk and dairy products, meat and leather, which have been critical to humankind. But they have been also much more than that. They provide companionship, are intelligent and playful, and can actually have very good taste in music.</p>
