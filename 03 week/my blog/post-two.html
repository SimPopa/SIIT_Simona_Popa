                <h1>Why do we need cows in our life?</h1>
                <p>As a general rule, cows have been used as a resource throughout history. They provide milk and dairy products, meat and leather, which have been critical to humankind. But they have been also much more than that. They provide companionship, are intelligent and playful, and can actually have very good taste in music.</p>

                <h1>Domestication and husbandry</h1>
                <p>Cattle occupy a unique role in human history, having been domesticated since at least the early neolithic age.</p>
                <p>Although European cattle are largely descended from the taurine lineage, gene flow from African cattle (partially of indicine origin) contributed substantial genomic components to both southern European cattle breeds and their New World descendants.[113] A study on 134 breeds showed that modern taurine cattle originated from Africa, Asia, North and South America, Australia, and Europe.[114] Some researchers have suggested that African taurine cattle are derived from a third independent domestication from North African aurochsen.</p>

                <h4>Usage as money</h4>
                <p>As early as 9000 BC both grain and cattle were used as money or as barter (the first grain remains found, considered to be evidence of pre-agricultural practice date to 17,000 BC).[115][116][117] Some evidence also exists to suggest that other animals, such as camels and goats, may have been used as currency in some parts of the world.[118] One of the advantages of using cattle as currency is that it allows the seller to set a fixed price. It even created the standard pricing. For example, two chickens were traded for one cow as cows were deemed to be more valuable than chickens.</p>
                <h4>Economy</h4>
                <p>The meat of adult cattle is known as beef, and that of calves is veal. Other animal parts are also used as food products, including blood, liver, kidney, heart and oxtail. Cattle also produce milk, and dairy cattle are specifically bred to produce the large quantities of milk processed and sold for human consumption. Cattle today are the basis of a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. The international trade in beef for 2000 was over $30 billion and represented only 23% of world beef production.[129] Approximately 300 million cattle, including dairy cattle, are slaughtered each year for food.[130] The production of milk, which is also made into cheese, butter, yogurt, and other dairy products, is comparable in economic size to beef production, and provides an important part of the food supply for many of the world's people. Cattle hides, used for leather to make shoes, couches and clothing, are another widespread product. Cattle remain broadly used as draft animals in many developing countries, such as India. Cattle are also used in some sporting games, including rodeo and bullfighting.</p>

                <h1>Temperament and emotions</h1>
                <p>In cattle, temperament can affect production traits such as carcass and meat quality or milk yield as well as affecting the animal's overall health and reproduction. Cattle temperament is defined as "the consistent behavioral and physiological difference observed between individuals in response to a stressor or environmental challenge and is used to describe the relatively stable difference in the behavioral predisposition of an animal, which can be related to psychobiological mechanisms".[70] Generally, cattle temperament is assumed to be multidimensional. Five underlying categories of temperament traits have been proposed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>shyness–boldness</li>
                    <li>exploration–avoidance</li>
                    <li>activity</li>
                    <li>aggressiveness</li>
                    <li>sociability</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Cognition</h4>
                <p>In laboratory studies, young cattle are able to memorize the locations of several food sources and retain this memory for at least 8 hours, although this declined after 12 hours.[52] Fifteen-month-old heifers learn more quickly than adult cows which have had either one or two calvings, but their longer-term memory is less stable.[53] Mature cattle perform well in spatial learning tasks and have a good long-term memory in these tests. Cattle tested in a radial arm maze are able to remember the locations of high-quality food for at least 30 days. Although they initially learn to avoid low-quality food, this memory diminishes over the same duration.[54] Under less artificial testing conditions, young cattle showed they were able to remember the location of feed for at least 48 days.[55] Cattle can make an association between a visual stimulus and food within 1 day—memory of this association can be retained for 1 year, despite a slight decay.</p>
