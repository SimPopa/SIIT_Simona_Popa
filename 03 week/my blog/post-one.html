                <h1>What even are cows?</h1>
                <p>Cows are lovely and <strong>majestic</strong> animals. They have been domesticated somewhere around 10,000 years ago, and some religions have worshiped and adored them since the beginning of time</p>
                <p>Cattle (Bos taurus or Bos primigenius taurus), also known as taurine cattle, Eurasian cattle, or European cattle, are large domesticated cloven-hooved herbivores. They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae and the most widespread species of the genus Bos. In taxonomy, adult females are referred to as cows and adult males are referred to as bulls. However, since there is no gender-neutral singular form for cattle, in colloquial speech cow is sometimes used as the gender-neutral singular form or as a common name for the species as a whole.</p>

                <h1>The features of cows..</h1>
                <h4>Anatomy</h4>
                <p>Cattle are large quadrupedal ungulate mammals with cloven hooves. Most breeds have horns, which can be as large as the Texas Longhorn or small like a scur. Careful genetic selection has allowed polled (hornless) cattle to become widespread.</p>
                <h4>Digestive system</h4>
                <p>Cattle are ruminants, meaning their digestive system is highly specialized to allow the consumption of difficult to digest plants as food. Cattle have one stomach with four compartments, the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum, with the rumen being the largest compartment. The reticulum, the smallest compartment, is known as the "honeycomb". The omasum's main function is to absorb water and nutrients from the digestible feed. The omasum is known as the "many plies". The abomasum is like the human stomach; this is why it is known as the "true stomach".</p>

                <h1>Religion of cows..</h1>
                <h4>Islamic traditions</h4>
                <p>The cow is mentioned often in the Quran. The second and longest surah of the Quran is named Al-Baqara ("The Cow"). Out of the 286 verses of the surah, seven mention cows (Al Baqarah 67–73).The name of the surah derives from this passage in which Moses orders his people to sacrifice a cow in order to resurrect a man murdered by an unknown person.</p>
                <h4>Hindu traditions</h4>
                <p>Veneration of the cow has become a symbol of the identity of Hindus as a community,: 20  especially since the end of the 19th century. Slaughter of cows (including oxen, bulls and calves) is forbidden by law in several states of the Indian Union. McDonald's outlets in India do not serve any beef burgers. In Maharaja Ranjit Singh's empire of the early 19th century, the killing of a cow was punishable by death.</p>
